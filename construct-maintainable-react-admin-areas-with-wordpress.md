# Construct Maintainable React Admin Areas with WordPress CMS



When I embarked on my journey as a web developer years ago, the prospect of building custom administrative interfaces felt like an insurmountable challenge. Developing modular, reusable components seemed like a sophisticated skill reserved for senior engineers at prominent agencies.

Fast forward to today, and as a frontend developer at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/), I've had the privilege to work on numerous headless CMS-driven admin dashboards using React. The frameworks and tools have advanced to a point where what was once considered out of reach is now well within the grasp of many developers.

One observation I've made is that while tutorials often cover the basics of setting up a React app to consume WordPress data, they frequently lack guidance on architecting reusable, future-proof solutions. They also fall short in providing best practices for organizing code, managing state, and expanding features over time.

Having tackled these challenges directly on client projects at Hybrid, I'm excited to present a comprehensive tutorial on building a fully-fledged modular admin dashboard interface. The approach I'll showcase revolves around the separation of presentational and container components, the implementation of custom hooks for data handling and side effects, and the creation of a robust foundation that easily accommodates the addition of new admin modules.

Rather than simply connecting to a REST API, my aim is to guide you in creating an admin application using the best practices for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. By the end, you'll be well-versed in practical techniques for structuring modular React applications driven by WordPress as a CMS, without the need for guesswork or reinventing the wheel with each new feature.

## Setting Up WordPress as a Headless CMS

The initial step is to install WordPress. You can download and extract the files to your local development environment or launch WordPress on a hosting provider. For my demonstration, I'll be using MAMP on my local machine.

Once WordPress is installed, we need to enable the REST API functionality. This allows frontend applications to interact with WordPress data through RESTful endpoints. To do this, navigate to Plugins > Add New and search for "REST API." Install and activate the REST API plugin.

Next, we configure the core API permissions by adding this code to our theme's `functions.php` file:

```php
function allow_any_rest_request() {
  remove_filter('rest_pre_serve_request', 'rest_send_cors_headers');
}
add_action('rest_api_init', 'allow_any_rest_request');
```

This code allows requests from any domain, which is essential during development when our React app resides on a different origin.

The following step involves registering custom post types so that our React app can fetch and manage customized content types beyond the core WordPress post types like posts and pages. We'll create a custom post type named "Projects" by adding this code:

```php
function create_project_post_type() {
  register_post_type( 'project',
    array(
      'labels' => array(
        'name' => __( 'Projects' ),
      ),
    )
  );
}
add_action( 'init', 'create_project_post_type' );
```

## Building the React Admin App

To initiate our React app, execute `npx create-react-app admin-app` from the command line. This command sets up a basic React project that serves as the foundation for our dashboard.

Our first component is `Posts.js`, which is responsible for fetching and displaying post data from WordPress. We import the `useEffect` hook and make a GET request to the `POSTS` endpoint:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Posts() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setPosts(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

This code covers the basics of setting up WordPress as a headless CMS and rendering the data within our React interface. In the upcoming sections, we'll implement functionality for creating/updating posts and setting up routing.

## Fetching Posts Data

The `useEffect` hook enables us to retrieve data from the API when the component mounts. We import `useEffect` and define state variables for the `posts` array and a `loading` state:

```js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Posts() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // API call
  }, []);
}
```

Within the `useEffect` block, we send a GET request to the WordPress REST API posts endpoint. Once the response is received, we parse the JSON data and save it to the state. This triggers a re-render of the component with the new data:

```js
fetch('/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    setPosts(data);
    setLoading(false);
  });
```

## Displaying Posts

Now that we have obtained the posts data, it's time to display it. We create a `Post` component to render each individual post. This component accepts the post as a prop and extracts the relevant fields.

Additionally, we structure the overall layout and apply styling using Material UI grid, cards, and typography components. This not only enhances the visual appeal but also improves the organization of the user interface.

Within `Posts.js`, we map over the `posts` state array and render a `Post` component for each post. Consequently, the title, excerpt, and other details are presented in an appealing grid format.

## Adding Posts 

For the form used to add new posts, we employ the `useState` hook to manage input values and errors within the state. We define an initial state object and associated setter functions.

Validation and submission are handled through a Formik wrapper. Upon submission, it triggers a `handleSubmit` function that initiates the API request to create a new post.

Furthermore, we implement error handling to display any errors that might occur during the API request. This approach offers a more user-friendly experience compared to generic alerts.

## Routing and Layout

React Router comes into play for defining routes and navigation in our single-page application. We set up Router and add Route paths for the main pages. Common UI elements such as headers are extracted into reusable `Header.js` and `Sidebar.js` components. These components are rendered on every route using `props.children`.

Additionally, we conditionally display button links for adding new posts and navigating between sections using the React Router Link component. This effectively integrates all the components into a polished admin interface.

## Embracing Modularity

Now that we've covered the basics of fetching, displaying, and managing posts, it's time to enhance the modularity and reusability of our code. This involves abstracting shared logic and user interface elements into custom hooks and components.

An excellent starting point is the data-fetching logic. Currently, we have `useEffect` calls directly within our `Posts` component, but this logic can be abstracted. Let's create a `useApiData` hook that handles GET requests and returns the data:

```js
function useApiData(endpoint) {
  const [data, setData] =

 useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(endpoint)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, [endpoint]);

  return data;
}
```

Now, within `Posts`, we can utilize this hook, resulting in cleaner and more concise component code:

```js
function Posts() {
  const posts = useApiData('/posts');
  return (
    <PostList posts={posts} />
  )
}
```

This refactoring makes our data-fetching logic reusable across various components.

As we expand the admin features, we can divide sections into logical feature modules that fully encapsulate related user interface and logic. Let's introduce a "Profiles" section for managing site users. We'll create a `Profiles` module with its own route, and we'll leverage the `useApiData` hook:

```js
function Profiles() {
  const profiles = useApiData('/profiles');
  return (
    <ProfileList profiles={profiles} />
  );
}
```

Developing modular, reusable components organizes our code and simplifies maintenance when adding new features. Common utilities like hooks prevent code duplication across the application. This structure also makes the admin interface highly customizable, allowing modules to be included or excluded as needed. Other sections, such as settings, can follow the same modular pattern.

In summary, focusing on modularity and the separation of concerns ensures that the admin dashboard can gracefully scale as requirements evolve over time, especially in our hybrid agency.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've delved into the art of architecting a modular React admin dashboard powered by WordPress as a headless CMS. By segregating the frontend from the backend, adhering to best practices in component structure and reusable logic, and emphasizing modularity, we've established a foundation that can easily accommodate the continued enhancement of the admin interface.

While the basics of rendering and managing WordPress content are straightforward, the real value lies in crafting solutions built to last. Developing applications using techniques like custom hooks, feature modules, and the separation of concerns ensures that sites can adapt and evolve in a sustainable way without requiring extensive refactoring.

This becomes particularly important for businesses like ours at Hybrid Web Agency, which offers customized [WordPress development services in Chesapeake](https://hybridwebagency.com/chesapeake-va/custom-wordpress-development-services/).
